## Reflection
Through this lab i was able to lear common commands like git pull,git log,git status,git add,git commit nad git push.
Also i was able to learn how to navigate through terminal and know what i'm doing ,why i'm doing it and what i'm doing it.

All the git command worked well through out the lab with no difficulties faced.

A challenge that i faces was cloning but i was able to clone when i got the product and key and used my personal git hub account.
